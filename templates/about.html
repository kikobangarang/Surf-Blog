        <p>Hey there! Welcome to my <strong>surf blog experiment</strong>, a project I built while learning <strong>Django</strong>. This site is all about surfing, but more importantly, it's where I tested out web development concepts like <strong>templates, views, models, and web scraping</strong>.</p>

        <h4>🏄 What This Site Does</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Displays surf-related Blog Posts</li>
            <li>Uses <strong>web scraping</strong> to pull surf forecasts</li>
            <li>Lets me practice working with <strong>Django, Python, and HTML/CSS</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🌊 Why I Built It</h4>
        <p>I wanted to get hands-on experience with <strong>Django</strong> and explore how to integrate <strong>web scraping</strong> into a project.</p>

        <h4>⚙️ Tech Stack</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Django 🐍</li>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) 🎨</li>

            Building this project has been an invaluable experience in mastering Django fundamentals, from setting up views and templates to implementing web scraping. It has strengthened my understanding of full-stack development and how to integrate dynamic data into a web application.
